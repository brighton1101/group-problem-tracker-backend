[Google doc w/ background](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nu8vJMQFwJA51gYqIZN_gatAuD9yrVyN1CdjvrwFD4/edit#)

Still a WIP...personal project between friends.
What we hope to accomplish technically:
- Learn how to build end to end backend using cloud infrastructure tooling/infrastructure and microservices design pattern
- Learn how to build functional, intuitive, and interactive UI with modern JS technology
